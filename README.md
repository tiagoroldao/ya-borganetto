# Yet Another Borganetto

This is the software core (and future repository for open hardware designs as well) for the "To Borg a 'Netto" project. 

This project was inspired by [Borganetto](https://www.facebook.com/borganetto/), and aims to create a opensource + open hardware process for digitizing diatonic accordions (namely old models, with unusable reeds).

Proudly doing this on - and with extensive support from - the [SciFabLab](http://scifablab.ictp.it) in Trieste.
